# Python_Scripts
All the Python scripts I have written over the course of my PhD that I have found most useful.
They are separated into the groups:

************************
**Hugoniot Calculation**
************************
########################

These scripts are ones I use to calculate Hugoniots from simple 2D planar 
impact simulations in iSALE. They are typically designed to use multiple
suites of simulations and generate several Hugoniots at once. Two methods
are used in these.
########################


************
**Diagrams**
************
########################

Each script in this folder produces a diagram relevant to my work using
matplotlib.
########################

*****************
**grain library**
*****************
########################

A series of text files, each represents a 'grain' to be used in conjunction
with pySALESetup where necessary. Each grain is present in a fully resolved
state and as a series of normalised cartesian coordinates.
#########################

***********************
**plotting & analysis**
***********************
########################

These scripts are ones I have used to analyse individual particle beds and
plot the data generated by simulations where Hugoniots are not wanted.
########################

*********************
**pySALESetup files**
*********************
########################

The files involved in the pre-processing tool 'pySALESetup'.
This includes the module, a number of files I work with, that use it, and 
several examples, which are denoted as such. This folder also contains grain 
generation and sorting routines.
